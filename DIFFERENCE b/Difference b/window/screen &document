Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript
Window
	The window is the actual global object.
	it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
	window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
	The window contains everything, so you can call window.screen and window.document to get those elements.



Screen
	The screen is the screen, it contains properties about the user's display
o	The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
	screen properties width and height are the full screen
	 The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with top, left, bottom, and right properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.



Document

	The document is where the DOM is.
	Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id. E.g., in the HTML snippet



<body>
  <p id="NAME"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
</body>
